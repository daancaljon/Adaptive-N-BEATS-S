# Adaptive-N-BEATS-S

This repo contains the code for the extensions to N-BEATS-S (Van Belle, J., Crevits, R., & Verbeke, W. (2022). Improving forecast stability
using deep learning. International Journal of Forecasting.) [Link text](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016920702200098X) using adaptive loss balancing. It contains implementations for GradNorm, (weighted) Gradient Cosine Similarity, and Random Weighting (Cap). 

The following code was used as a starting point for the extensions to N-BEATS-S:
